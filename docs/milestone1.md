# Milestone 1 - Environment Setup and Project Structure

## What I Did
- Installed Git
- Installed GitHub Desktop
- Installed Visual Studio Code
- Created the hr-delta360 project folder on my system
- Organized the project folder structure
- Initialized Git in the local folder
- Published the repository to GitHub

## Why This Matters
This sets the foundation for the entire HR-Delta360 project.  
A clean structure and version control make the project maintainable and professional.

## Project Folder Structure
hr-delta360/
├─ docs/
├─ data/
│  └─ raw/
├─ notebooks/
├─ scripts/
├─ dags/
├─ tests/
└─ infra/

## Tools Installed
- Git: version control
- GitHub Desktop: easy syncing with GitHub
- VS Code: main code editor

## Notes for Myself
- Always document what I learn in the 'docs' folder.
- Always commit and push changes after finishing a task.
- This documentation helps me remember every step when I revisit the project.
